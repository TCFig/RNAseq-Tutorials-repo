# RNAseq-Tutorials-repo
On this repositiory I have all the code I have learned through online tutorials and videos.

## DESeq2
In the directory DESeq2 I have code for the tutorial "RNA-seq workflow: gene-level exploratory analysis and differential expression" by Love et al. 2019 - available through https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html#transcript-quantification-and-tximport-tximeta

This tutorial uses DESeq2 to analyse transcriptomic data of smooth muscle cells treated with dexamethasone (data present in the R package "airway")

## Project Malaria Data
The directory Project-malaria-data contains code for a project I set up to do using the DESeq2 tutorial as a backbone. 

This project uses transcriptomic data from malaria parasites related with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria (data available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA776243). 

The directory contains also a file (Testing_Pf_data) with important files for the code.

## EdgeR
In the directory EdgeR the code available is from an online class from Stanford University - available from https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/labs/rnaseq/lab_4_rnaseq.html

This tutorial uses EdgeR to analyse counts acquired for three thousand small RNA loci from a set of Arabidopsis grafting experiments (data present in the R package "baySeq")
